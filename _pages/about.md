Welcome!
I'm a 1st grade Ph.D. graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, in Computer Science and Engineering.
I joined the System Energy Efficiency Lab (SeeLab) led by Professor Tajana Rosing. 
My research interest includes `processing in memory` and `near memory processing` using state-of-the-art machines.
